TowerSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), and the Exchange is at the heart of TowerSwap. TowerSwap is the leading AMM on the Cadeceus Chain (CMP).

The TowerSwap Exchange offers several features that support decentralized trading:

### Swapping/Trading

TowerSwap lets users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on TowerSwap is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to trust someone else with your coins!

### Liquidity Pools

You can only swap tokens on TowerSwap if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.

### Yield Farming

Yield farming lets users that are providing liquidity earn Tower Token rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract.
